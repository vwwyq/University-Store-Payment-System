## Implementation Summary

I've implemented the three requested features for your Campus Marketplace application:

### 1. Currency Conversion

- Created a `formatCurrency` utility function that formats numbers as Indian Rupees (₹)
- Updated all price displays across the application to use this function
- Ensured consistent formatting with the Indian numbering system (lakhs, crores)


### 2. Authentication Restriction

- Implemented a Next.js middleware that:

- Restricts access to all pages except the home page (About Us), login, and signup
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page
- Preserves the original URL as a redirect parameter for after login
- Redirects logged-in users away from login/signup pages





### 3. User Profile Display

- Created an AuthProvider context to manage user authentication state
- Implemented user profile information display on the profile page
- Made user data accessible throughout the application via the useAuth hook
- Updated the dashboard navigation to show the logged-in user's information
- Added proper avatar display with user initials as fallback


### How to Test

1. **Authentication Flow**:

1. Visit any protected page while logged out - you should be redirected to login
2. Log in with test credentials (e.g., [john.doe@kiit.ac.in](mailto:john.doe@kiit.ac.in) / password123)
3. You should be redirected to the originally requested page



2. **Currency Display**:

1. Check product listings, cart, wallet, and other pages
2. All prices should now display in ₹ format (e.g., ₹1,200 instead of $15)



3. **User Profile**:

1. After logging in, visit the profile page
2. You should see your name, email, university, and other details
3. The avatar should show your initials if no profile image is available
4. Your wallet balance should be displayed in ₹





These changes provide a more localized experience for Indian users, better security through proper authentication, and improved user experience by displaying relevant user information throughout the application.
